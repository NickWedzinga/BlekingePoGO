# TODO: put pull time in database,
#  if pull time seems wrong Sneasel needs to be able to pull hourly
#  Sneasel should pull 8 different 8 hourly periods for 8 hours and ask each hour if that pull is correct
#  If a pull is wrong then that pull time is excluded until one pull time remains

#  TODO: EXAMPLE
#   Default pull time is 06:00, which translates to 06:00 -> 14:00 -> 22:00
#   Niantic changes pull time so Sneasel starts reporting incorrect weather
#   Admin can trigger pull time checker at any time, let's say for example it's 09:45
#   Sneasel will then pull 8 hours periods at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00 and 17:00
#   Each hour Sneasel will ask admin to verify if weather is correct
#   So for example at 13:00 Sneasel will ask:
#   React with all weather types that are INCORRECT: A(10:00): Cloudy, B(11:00): Partly Cloudy, C(12:00): Cloudy, D(13:00): Snowy
#   The weather in Pok√©mon GO is cloudy so pull times for 11:00 and 13:00 are excluded since they were incorrect
#   Sneasel will thus remove any pull times that get reactions
#   Sneasel keeps asking for all living pull times every hour until only one remains which must be the correct pull time
